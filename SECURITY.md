# Security

I take security bugs in code seriously. I appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any this repository please report it to me as described below.

# Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, to report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/blowdart/idunno.Bluesky.Utils/security/advisories/new) form.

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If, for some reason, you do not please feel free to follow up via [email](https://idunno.org/#contact) to ensure I received your report.

Where possible please include the requested information listed below to help me better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

* This information will help me triage your report more quickly.
